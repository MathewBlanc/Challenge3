# Climb
**Fight your phobias with gradual exposure**

### Motivation

As someone with a phobia, I have seen first-hand how treating phobias can improve your life. While never a pleasant task, a properly designed and administered course of gradual exposure.
Unfortunately, therapy is out of reach for many people because of its cost. Also, between therapy sessions, there's little motivation to look at unpleasant images without any support.

To this end, I have created **Climb**, an app designed to help people with phobias take steps on their phobia journey. Users first set appropriate phobia goals, based around things that their phobia prevents them from doing (no, you don't need to touch a spider!). Climb then uses multiple different app-based experiences to allow users to expose themselves to these phobia triggers in a calm environment, while retaining control. 

#### Slider sessions

In this experience, users use a slider to gradually increase the size of an image. When the image is large enough a countdown timer begins, encouraging users to sit with the discomfort and work through their fear.

#### AR sessions

In this experience, users us the camera on their phone to place a virtual phobia stimulus on a table or the floor in front of them. In the future, tapping the phobia stimulus will cause it to come "closer" to in the camera view.

#### Inspiration

There were a few apps that I drew inspiration from to create the UI for Climb.
